License text: [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/choojs/findup.png)](http://travis-ci.org/choojs/findup)
@choojs/findup
=======

> This is a fork of [Filirom1/findup](https://github.com/Filirom1/findup), pending [#16](https://github.com/Filirom1/findup/pull/16).

### Install

```sh
npm install -g @choojs/findup
```

### Usage

Find up a file in ancestor's dir


    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ f
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ e
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ d
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ c
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b
                    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ a
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json

### Options

- `maxdepth`: (Number, default -1) How far to traverse before giving up. If maxdepth is `-1`, then there is no limit.

#### Async

findup(dir, fileName, options, callback)
findup(dir, iterator, options, callback) with `iterator(dir, cb)` where cb only accept `true` or `false`

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');


findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json', function(err, dir){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
});
```

or

```js
findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', function(dir, cb){
  require('path').exists(dir + '/config.json', cb);
}, function(err, dir){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
});
```

#### EventEmitter

findup(dir, fileName, options)

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');
var fup = findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json');
```

findup(dir, iterator, options) with `iterator(dir, cb)` where cb only accept `true` or `false`

```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');
var fup = findup(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', function(dir, cb){
  require('path').exists(dir + '/config.json', cb);
});
```

findup return an EventEmitter. 3 events are emitted: `found`, `error`, `end`

`found` event is emitted each time a file is found.

You can stop the traversing by calling `stop` manually.

```js
fup.on('found', function(dir){
  // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
  fup.stop();
});
```

`error` event is emitted when error happens

```js
fup.on('error', function(e){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
});
```

`end` event is emitted at the end of the traversing or after `stop()` is
called.

```js
fup.on('end', function(){
  // happy end
});
```

#### Sync

findup(dir, fileName)
findup(dir, iteratorSync) with `iteratorSync` return `true` or `false`
```js
var findup = require('@choojs/findup');

try{
  var dir = findup.sync(__dirname + '/f/e/d/c/b/a', 'config.json'); // dir === '/f/e/d/c'
}catch(e){
  // if(e) e === new Error('not found')
}
```

#### CLI
```js
npm install -g @choojs/findup

$ cd test/fixture/f/e/d/c/b/a/
$ findup package.json
/root/findup/package.json
```

Usage

```
$ findup -h

Usage: findup [FILE]

    --name, -n       The name of the file to found
    --dir, -d        The directoy where we will start walking up    $PWD
    --help, -h       show usage                                     false
    --verbose, -v    print log                                      false

License text: Copyright 2020 The Open Sans Project Authors (https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans)

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

Find min and max values of a sequence of values/coordinates.

[![npm install array-bounds](https://nodei.co/npm/array-bounds.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/array-bounds/)

```js
const getBounds = require('array-bounds')

let bounds = getBounds([0, 25, 50, 75, 100]) // [0, 100]
```

## API

### box = bounds(array, dim=1)

Figures out bounds of sequence of points using dimensions `dim` as stride, ie. for 1d values expected data layout is `[x, x, x, ...]` for 2d is `[x, y, x, y, ...]`, etc. Returned array contains bounds for every dimension as `[minX, minY, ..., maxX, maxY]`, eg.

```js
//get bounding box
let [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] = bounds([x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...], 2)

//get bounding cube
let [minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ] = bounds([x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...], 3)
```

Normalize array to unit length, that is 0..1 range. See [feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling).

[![npm install array-normalize](https://nodei.co/npm/array-normalize.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/array-normalize/)

```js
const normalize = require('array-normalize')

normalize([0, 50, 100]) // [0, .5, 1]
normalize([0, 0, .1, .2, 1, 2], 2) // [0, 0, .1, .1, 1, 1]
normalize([0, .25, 1, .25], 2, [0, .5, 1, .5]) // [0, .5, 1, .5])
```

## API

### array = normalize(array, dimensions=1, bounds?)

Normalizes n-dimensional array in-place using `dimensions` as stride, ie. for 1d array the expected data layout is `[x, x, x, ...]` for 2d is `[x, y, x, y, ...]`, etc.

Every dimension is normalized independently, eg. 2d array is normalized to unit square `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Optional `bounds` box can predefine min/max to optimize calculations.

License text: # bitmap-sdf [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Calculate signed distance field for an image / bw-data. Fork of [tiny-sdf](https://github.com/mapbox/tiny-sdf) with reduced API.

![bitmap-sdf](preview.png)

[Demo](https://dy.github.io/bitmap-sdf/)

## Usage

[![npm install bitmap-sdf](https://nodei.co/npm/bitmap-sdf.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/bitmap-sdf/)

```js
let calcSdf = requrie('bitmap-sdf')

//draw image
let canvas = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('canvas'))
let w = canvas.width = 200, h = canvas.height = 200
let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
ctx.fillStyle = 'white'
ctx.font = 'bold 30px sans-serif'
ctx.fillText('X', 20, 20)

//calculate distances
let distances = calcSdf(canvas)

//show distances
let imgArr = new Uint8ClampedArray(w*h*4)
for (let i = 0; i < w; i++) {
	for (let j = 0; j < h; j++) {
		imgArr[j*w*4 + i*4 + 0] = arr[j*w+i]*255
		imgArr[j*w*4 + i*4 + 1] = arr[j*w+i]*255
		imgArr[j*w*4 + i*4 + 2] = arr[j*w+i]*255
		imgArr[j*w*4 + i*4 + 3] = 255
	}
}
var data = new ImageData(imgArr, w, h)
ctx.putImageData(data, 0, 0)
```

### dist = calcSdf(source, options?)

Calculate distance field for the input `source` data, based on `options`. Returns 1-channel array with distance values from `0..1` range.

#### Source:

Type | Meaning
---|---
_Canvas_, _Context2D_ | Calculates sdf for the full canvas image data based on `options.channel`, by default `0`, ie. red channel.
_ImageData_ | Calculates sdf for the image data based on `options.channel`
_Uint8ClampedArray_, _Uint8Array_ | Handles raw pixel data, requires `options.width` and `options.height`. Stride is detected from `width` and `height`.
_Float32Array_, _Array_ | Handles raw numbers from `0..1` range, requires `options.width` and `options.height`. Stride is detected from `width` and `height`.

#### Options:

Property | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`cutoff` | `0.25` | Cutoff parameter, balance between SDF inside `1` and outside `0` of glyph
`radius` | `10` | Max length of SDF, ie. the size of SDF around the `cutoff`
`width` | `canvas.width` | Width of input data, if array
`height` | `canvas.height` | Height of input data, if array
`channel` | `0` | Channel number, `0` is red, `1` is green, `2` is blue, `3` is alpha.
`stride` | `null` | Explicitly indicate number of channels per pixel. Not needed if `height` and `width` are provided.

rgba('rgb(80, 120, 160)', 'uint8') // Uint8Array<[80, 120, 160, 255]>
rgba('rgba(255, 255, 255, .5)', 'float64') // Float64Array<[1, 1, 1, .5]>
rgba('hsla(109, 50%, 50%, .75)', 'uint8') // Uint8Array<[87, 191, 64, 191]>
rgba(new Float32Array([0, 0.25, 0, 1]), 'uint8_clamped') // Uint8ClampedArray<[0, 64, 0, 255]>
rgba(new Uint8Array([0, 72, 0, 255]), 'array') // [0, 0.2823529411764706, 0, 1]

// ambivalent input
rgba([0,0,0]) // [0,0,0]
rgba([.5,.5,.5]) // [.5,.5,.5]
rgba([1,1,1]) // [1,1,1]
rgba([127,127,127]) // [.5,.5,.5]
rgba([255,255,255]) // [1,1,1]
```

Output format can be any [dtype](https://npmjs.org/package/dtype): `uint8`, `uint8_clamped`, `array`, `float32`, `float64` etc. By default it converts to `array` with `0..1` range values.

[![npm install color-rgba](https://nodei.co/npm/color-rgba.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/color-rgba/)

```js
const rgba = require('color-rgba')

rgba('red') // [255, 0, 0, 1]
rgba('rgb(80, 120, 160)') // [80, 120, 160, 1]
rgba('rgba(80, 120, 160, .5)') // [80, 120, 160, .5]
rgba('hsla(109, 50%, 50%, .75)') // [87.125, 191.25, 63.75, .75]
```

## API

### `let [r, g, b, alpha] = rgba(color)`

Returns channels values as they are in the input `color` string argument. `alpha` is always from `0..1` range. `color` can be a CSS color string, an array with channel values, an object etc., see [color-parse](https://ghub.io/color-parse).

Calculate kerning pairs for a font.

[![npm install detect-kerning](https://nodei.co/npm/detect-kerning.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/detect-kerning/)

```js
const kerning = require('detect-kerning')

let pairs = kerning('Roboto')

/*
{
	'A‚Äù': -10,
	'W.': -5,
	'P,': -3,
	...
}
*/

// get px kerning for 16px font-size
let px = 16 * pairs['AV'] / 1000
```

### `pairs = kerning(family|familyList, pairs|range|options?)`

Detect kerning pairs for the font family or stack of families and return their kerning in 1000 units/em. Optionally pass specific kerning pairs to check, or a unicode range, by default all printable ASCII character pairs are detected from the `[32, 126]` range. Alternatively, an options object can define:

* `options.pairs` - specific pairs to check;
* `options.range` - unicode range to detect pairs from;
* `options.fontSize` - base font size to use for check. Can affect performance, by default 16.
* `options.threshold` - font size (em) ratio to detect kerning, by default 0.05. Values below that number can bloat kerning table size.

draw-svg-path draws a [parsed SVG path](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-svg-path) onto a canvas context.

[![Browser support](https://ci.testling.com/michaelrhodes/draw-svg-path.png)](https://ci.testling.com/michaelrhodes/draw-svg-path)

<small>Older browsers might require a polyfill for [Array.prototype.forEach](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Array.prototype.forEach).</small>

## Install
```sh
$ npm install michaelrhodes/draw-svg-path
```

## API
```js
draw(context, path)
```

### Example
``` js
var parse = require('parse-svg-path')
var draw = require('draw-svg-path')

var path = parse('M10 10 L15 15')
var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
var context = canvas.getContext('2d')

context.lineWidth = 1
context.strokeStyle = '#000000'
context.fillStyle = 'transparent'
// Do actual drawing
draw(context, path)
context.stroke()
```

## API

### `let metrics = measure(family, options?)`

Get metrics data for a font family or [CSS font string](), possibly with custom options. Font can be a string or an array with fonts.

#### `metrics`:

<img src="https://github.com/dy/font-measure/raw/master/sphinx.svg?sanitize=true" width="720"/>


#### `options`:

Property | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`origin` | `top` | Origin for metrics. Can be changed to `baseline` or any other metric.
`fontSize` | `64` | Font-size to use for calculations. Larger size gives higher precision with slower performance.
`fontWeight` | `normal` | Font weight to use for calculations, eg. `bold`, `700` etc.
`fontStyle` | `normal` | Font style to use for calculations, eg. `italic`, `oblique`.
`canvas` | `measure.canvas` | Canvas to use for measurements.
`tittle` | `i` | Character to detect tittle. `null` disables calculation.
`descent` | `p` | Character to detect descent line. `null` disables calculation.
`ascent` | `h` | Character to detect ascent line. `null` disables calculation.
`overshoot` | `O` | Character to detect overshoot. `null` disables calculation.
`upper` | `H` | Character to detect upper line / cap-height. `null` disables calculation.
`lower` | `x` | Character to detect lower line / x-height. `null` disables calculation.

License text: # gl-util [![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Set of practical functions for webgl.

[![npm install gl-util](https://nodei.co/npm/gl-util.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/gl-util/)

```js
const u = require('gl-util');

let gl = u.context(canvas)

let prog = u.program(gl, `
	precision mediump float;

	attribute vec2 position;

	void main() {
		gl_Position = vec4(position * 2. - 1., 0, 1);
	}
`, `
	precision mediump float;

	uniform vec4 color;

	void main () {
		gl_FragColor = color;
	}
`);
u.attribute(prog, 'position', [0,0, 1,0, 0,1]);
u.uniform(prog, 'color', [1, .2, 0, 1.]);

gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
```

## API

### `context(container|canvas|options?)`

Create and/or return WebGL context for the canvas element, possibly based on options. If `container` is not defined, `document.body` is used.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `canvas` | A canvas element to obtain context for. |
| `container` | An element to create canvas in and return context for it. |
| `width` | If specified, will set the canvas width. |
| `height` | If specified, will set the canvas height. |
| `pixelRatio` | Multiplier for `width` and `height`. |
| `attributes` | Attributes object. Available attributes: `alpha`, `depth`, `stencil`, `antialias`, `premultipliedAlpha`, `preserveDrawingBuffer` and `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat`. |

```js
const getContext = require('gl-util/context')

// create canvas element in the document.body and retrieve context for it
let gl = getContext({
	attributes: {
		antialias: true
	}
})
```

### `prog = program(gl, prog|vert?, frag?)`

Set active program or create a new program from vertex and fragment sources. Programs are cached for the context by source. The _WebGLProgram_ instance is returned.

```js
const program = require('gl-util/program')

// create and set program
let prog = program(gl, `
	precision mediump float;

	attribute vec2 position;

	void main() {
		gl_Position = vec4(position * 2. - 1., 0, 1);
	}
`, `
	precision mediump float;

	uniform sampler2D image;
	uniform vec2 shape;
	uniform float x;

	void main () {
		gl_FragColor = texture2D(image, gl_FragCoord.xy / shape);
	}
`)

// set active program
program(gl, prog)
```

### `unif = uniform(gl|program, {name: data, ...} | name?, data?)`

Get/set uniform or multiple uniforms. Returns an object with uniform parameters: `{name, location, data, type}`. Uniforms are stored per-program instance.

```js
const uniform = require('gl-util/uniform')

uniform(gl, 'color', [1, .2, 0, 1]);
```

### `txt = texture(gl, {name: params, ...} | name?, params?)`

Set texture[s] data or parameters:

| Name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `data` | Data passed to texture. Can be array, typed array, image, canvas or string denoting the URL of image to load. |
| `index` | Texture unit number, if undefined - calculated automatically. |
| `filter` | Sets texture scaling for both min and mag. Can be defined as two separate properties `minFilter` and `magFilter`. By default `gl.LINEAR`. |
| `wrap` | Defines texture tiling vertically and horizontally. Can be defined precisely as `wrapS` and `wrapT`. By default `gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, can be `gl.MIRRORED_REPEAT` or `gl.`. |
| `width` | In pixels |
| `height` | In pixels |
| `format` | `gl.ALPHA`, `gl.RGB`, `gl.RGBA` (default), `gl.LUMINANCE`, `gl.LUMINANCE_ALPHA`, `gl.DEPTH_COMPONENT`, `gl.DEPTH_STENCIL`, [etc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/texImage2D) |
| `type` | `gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE`, can be `gl.FLOAT` with proper extension enabled |
| `level` | `0`, mipmap level. |

Returns object with texture properties `{data, index, location, minFilter, magFilter, wrapS, wrapT, width, height, format, type, texture}`.

```js
const texture = require('gl-util/texture')

let {width, height} = texture(gl, 'image', './picture.gif');
```

### `attr = attribute(gl, {name: params, ...} | name?, params?)`

Set attribute[s] data or parameters:

| Name | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `data` | `null` | Data for the attribute, can be array, typed array or array buffer |
| `size` | `2` | Number of data items per vertex |
| `stride` | `0` | Offset in bytes between the beginning of consecutive vertex attributes. |
| `offset` | `0` | Offset in bytes of the first component in the data. Must be a multiple of type. |
| `type` | `gl.FLOAT` | Data type of each component in the `data` array. Must be one of: `gl.BYTE`, `gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE`, `gl.SHORT`, `gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT`, `gl.FLOAT`. |
| `usage` | `gl.STATIC_DRAW` | Mode of draw: `gl.STATIC_DRAW` (rare changes), `gl.DYNAMIC_DRAW` (frequent changes) or `gl.STREAM_DRAW` (frequent updates) |
| `normalized` | `false` | If fixed-point data values should be normalized or are to converted to fixed point values when accessed. |
| `index` | `0` | Attribute unit number, detected automatically if omitted. |
| `target` | `gl.ARRAY_BUFFER` | |
| `buffer` | `null` | WebGLBuffer to use for attribute |

Returns attribute properties `{data, size, stride, offset, usage, type, normalized, index, target, buffer}`.

```js
const attribute = require('gl-util/attribute')

attribute(gl, 'position', [0,0,1,0,0,1]);
```

### `clear(gl, optsion?)`

Clear the viewport.

## Motivation

There are [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl), [stack.gl](https://github.com/stackgl/) and many other WegGL components or frameworks, so why gl-util?

* WebGL frameworks API is usually difficult to remember, not much better than pure WebGL, although _regl_ does a great job. _gl-util_ is like functions from any WebGL tutorial - tiny, handy and already familiar.
* _gl-util_ does not supersede WebGL API - that allows for debugging pure WebGL at any moment.
* _gl-util_ is tiny - if one needs minimalistic WebGL setup it may be better to opt for a couple of functions than massive stack.gl components or regl (70kb+).
* regl API may be cumbersome for organizing components

Package: glslify-deps@1.3.2
Repository: https://github.com/stackgl/glslify-deps
Publisher: Hugh Kennedy
Email: hughskennedy@gmail.com
License: ISC
License Filename: README.md
License text: # glslify-deps

Walk the dependency graph of a [glslify](http://github.com/stackgl/glslify)
shader.

`glslify-deps` is responsible for resolving your shader's dependencies and
applying their transforms before the actual source modification occurs. You may
notice some parallels here with [browserify](http://browserify.org)'s
[module-deps](http://github.com/substack/module-deps) package.

While `glslify-deps` is an "internal" package for `glslify`, it may be useful
to use this package directly in specific cases, e.g. building a file tree
server-side but bundling the final shader on the client.

## Module API

There is an asynchronous and a synchronous API:

``` js
var glslifyDeps = require('glslify-deps')
var glslifyDepsSync = require('glslify-deps/sync')
```

The asynchronous API is documented below. For every method in the asychronous
API, instead of a `callback(err, result)`, the result is available as the return
value of the method.

### `depper = glslifyDeps([options])`

Creates a fresh `glslify-deps` instance. Accepts the following options:

* `cwd`: the current working directory to resolve relative file paths from.
* `readFile`: pass in a custom function reading files.
* `resolve`: pass in a custom function for resolving require calls. It has
  the same signature as [glsl-resolve](http://github.com/hughsk/glsl-resolve).
* `files`: a filename/source object mapping of files to prepopulate
  the file cache with. Useful for overriding particular file paths manually,
  most notably the "entry" file.

### `depper.transform(transform, [options])`

Adds a new transform ‚Äì should be used before calling `depper.add`.

`transform` may either be a string (which is resolved like a `require` call),
or a function. More information on transforms can be found below.

### `depper.add(filename, [callback])`

Adds a new file to the dependency graph.

### `depper.inline(source, basedir, [callback])`

Adds a new inline file to the dependency graph, where `source` is the GLSL
source to include and `basedir` is the directory to pretend it's being
created in. A `basedir` is required to properly resolve requires and transforms,
and defaults to `process.cwd()`.

### `depper.on('file', cb(filename))`

Emitted whenever a new file has been included in the dependency graph.

## Example Output

``` json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "deps": { "glsl-random": 1 },
    "file": "index.glsl",
    "source": "precision mediump float;\n#pragma glslify: random = require(glsl-random)\n",
    "entry": true
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "deps": {},
    "file": "node_modules/glsl-random/index.glsl",
    "source": "highp float random(vec2 co)\n{\n    highp float a = 12.9898;\n    highp float b = 78.233;\n    highp float c = 43758.5453;\n    highp float dt= dot(co.xy ,vec2(a,b));\n    highp float sn= mod(dt,3.14);\n    return fract(sin(sn) * c);\n}\n\n#pragma glslify: export(random)",
    "entry": false
  }
]
```

## Transform API

The transform API has changed since glslify 1.0 to make it more "vanilla".

With the asynchronous API, transforms have this signature:

``` javascript
module.exports = function(file, source, options, done) {
  done(null, source.toUpperCase())
}
```

and using the synchronous API, transforms have this signature:

``` javascript
module.exports.sync = function(file, source, options) {
  return source.toUpperCase()
}
```

For an example that is compatible with both the async and sync APIs, here's
[glslify-hex](http://github.com/hughsk/glslify-hex)
rewritten using the new API:

``` javascript
var through = require('through')

var regexLong  = /#([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})([a-f0-9]{2})?/gi
var regexShort = /#([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])([a-f0-9])?/gi

module.exports = transform
module.exports.sync = transform

function transform(filename, src, opts, done) {
  src = src.replace(regexShort, function(whole, r, g, b, a) {
    return !a
      ? '#' + r + r + g + g + b + b
      : '#' + r + r + g + g + b + b + a + a
  }).replace(regexLong, function(whole, r, g, b, a) {
    r = makeFloat(parseInt(r, 16) / 255)
    g = makeFloat(parseInt(g, 16) / 255)
    b = makeFloat(parseInt(b, 16) / 255)
    a = makeFloat(parseInt(a, 16) / 255)

    return isNaN(a)
      ? 'vec3('+[r,g,b].join(',')+')'
      : 'vec4('+[r,g,b,a].join(',')+')'
  })

  if (typeof done === 'function') done(null, src)
  return src
}

function makeFloat(n) {
  return String(n).indexOf('.') === -1
    ? n + '.'
    : n
}
```

## Transforms in `package.json`

Transforms now support options specified in `package.json`:

``` json
{
  "glslify": {
    "transform": [
       "glslify-hex",
      ["glslify-optimize", { "mangle": true }]
    ]
  }
}
```

Package: hsluv@0.0.3
Repository: https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv
Publisher: Alexei Boronine
Email: alexei@boronine.com
License: MIT
License Filename: README.md
License text: # HSL<sub>uv</sub> - Human-friendly HSL

## Installation

Client-side: download [the latest hsluv.min.js](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv/tree/master/javascript/dist).

Once this module is loaded in the browser, you can access it via the
global ``window.hsluv``.

Server-side: ``npm install hsluv``.

## Usage

Most functions take tuples, ie: Javascript arrays with three elements.  Make sure you are using
`func([a,b,c])` and not `func(a,b,c)`. If you are getting NaN for output then this is probably
the problem.

**hsluvToHex([hue, saturation, lightness])**

*hue* is a number between 0 and 360, *saturation* and *lightness* are
numbers between 0 and 100. This function returns the resulting color as
a hex string.

**hsluvToRgb([hue, saturation, lightness])**

Like above, but returns an array of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, for the
r, g, and b channel.

**hexToHsluv(hex)**

Takes a hex string and returns the HSLuv color as array that contains
the hue (0-360), saturation (0-100) and lightness (0-100) channel.
_Note:_ The result can have rounding errors. For example saturation can
be 100.00000000000007

**rgbToHsluv([red, green, blue])**

Like above, but *red*, *green* and *blue* are passed as numbers between
0 and 1.

Use **hpluvToHex**, **hpluvToRgb**, **hexToHpluv** and **rgbToHpluv** for
the pastel variant (HPLuv). Note that HPLuv does not contain all the colors
of RGB, so converting arbitrary RGB to it may generate invalid HPLuv colors.

For advance use cases, additional functions are avalible:

**hsluvToLch**, **lchToHsluv**

**hpluvToLch**, **lchToHpluv**

**rgbToXyz**, **xyzToRgb**

**rgbToLch**, **lchToRgb**

**luvToXyz**, **xyzToLuv**

**lchToLuv**, **luvToLch**

Also available for [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). See
[here](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv-stylus).

## Changelog

### 0.0.3

- Expose intermediate functions in the public API.

### 0.0.2

- Improve packaging and minification.

### 0.0.1

- Initial release under the name HSLuv. Old releases can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husl).

# is-mobile

Check if mobile browser, based on useragent string.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/is-mobile)

## Example

```js
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

console.log(mobile());
// => false
```

## API

### mobile({ [ua], [tablet], [featureDetect] })

Returns true if a mobile browser is being used.

If you don't specify `opts.ua` it will use `navigator.userAgent`.

To add support for tablets, set `tablet: true`.

To enable feature detection (i.e. namely for iPad with iOS 13), set `featureDetect: true` and `tablet: true`. This will only work in browser environments.

`opts.ua` can also be an instance of a [node.js http request](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage), in which
case it will read the user agent header.

Example:

```js
var http = require('http');
var mobile = require('is-mobile');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.end(mobile({ ua: req }));
});

server.listen(8000);
```

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install is-mobile
```

Bundle for the browser with
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

## Kudos

Taken from [detectmobilebrowsers.com](http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/).

Armv7l support added by [@antongolub](https://github.com/antongolub).

Test if a string is an SVG path.

[![npm install is-svg-path](https://nodei.co/npm/is-svg-path.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/is-svg-path/)

```js
const isPath = require('is-svg-path')

isPath('M0 0L10 20 20 0Z') //true
isPath('M00Z') //false
isPath('xyz') //false
```

It does not validate path data nor covers edge cases like `'H0'` etc., but rather detects path in real world.

License text: # MurmurHash.js

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

*	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
*	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 

## Install

    npm install murmurhash-js
    
## API

```javascript
var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
```

### Methods

#### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

#### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

**Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

Package: native-promise-only@0.8.1
Repository: https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only
Publisher: Kyle Simpson

License text: # Native Promise Only (NPO)

A polyfill for native ES6 Promises as close as possible (no extensions) to the strict spec definitions.

## Intent

The aim of this project is to be the smallest polyfill for Promises, staying as close as possible to what's specified in both [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com) and the [upcoming ES6 specification](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-promise-objects).

An equally important goal is to avoid exposing any capability for promise-state to be mutated externally. The [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) section below explains the trade-offs of that balance.

## Usage

To use this polyfill in the browser, include the "npo.js" file (see the instructions in [Tests/Compliance section](#testscompliance) below for how to build "npo.js" if you don't have it already) with your site's scripts. It's a polyfill, which means it will not overwrite `Promise` if it exists as a global already, so it's safe to include unconditionally.

To use with AMD, import the "npo.js" file module.

To install the polyfill via bower, run:

```
bower install native-promise-only
```

To install the polyfill via npm, run:

```
npm install native-promise-only
```

Then require the module into your node code:

```js
require("native-promise-only");
```

Notice that using the module in this way, we don't assign the module's public API to any variable. **We don't need to**, because it's a polyfill that intentionally patches the global environment (in this case to the `Promise` name) once included.

If you *want* to also have a reference pointing to the same `Promise` global, you *can also* assign the return value from the `require(..)` statement, but it's strongly recommended that you use the same `Promise` name so as to not create confusion:

```js
var Promise = require("native-promise-only");

// Promise === global.Promise; // true!
```

Other than the below [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) discussion and some browser bugs (such as [these](https://gist.github.com/getify/bd11ccf1eff2efdac0fb)) which **this polyfill doesn't suffer from**, your promises should operate the same in all JS environments.

Exactly like native promises, here's a quick example of how you create and use the polyfilled promises:

```js
var p = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	setTimeout(function(){
		resolve("Yay!");
	},100);
});

p.then(function(msg){
	console.log(msg); // Yay!
});
```

For more on promises, check these blog posts out:

1. Back-story on the hows and whys behind promises (chaining, errors, etc): [multi-part blog post series "Promises"](http://blog.getify.com/promises-part-1/) by [getify](http://twitter.com/getify) (me).
2. Using and enjoying native promises: [JavaScript Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) by [Jake Archibald](http://twitter.com/jaffathecake).

## Known Limitations

A promise object from this polyfill **will be** an instance of the `Promise` constructor, which makes identification of genuine promises easier:

```js
var p = new Promise(..);

p instanceof Promise; // true
```

However, these promise instances don't inherit (delegate to) a *meaningful* `Promise.prototype` object for their methods (there is one, it's just mostly empty).

Consider:

```js
var p = new Promise(..);

Object.getOwnPropertyNames( p ); // [ then, catch ]
Object.getOwnPropertyNames( Promise.prototype ); // [ constructor ]
```

As such, these promises are not really "sub-classable" in the ES6 `class` / `extends` sense, though theoretically you should be able to do that in ES6 with the built-in Promises.

To read a full explanation of why, read [Part 3: The Trust Problem](http://blog.getify.com/promises-part-3/) of my blog post series on Promises.

Briefly, the reason for this deviation is that there's a choice between having delegated methods on the `.prototype` or having private state. Since **the spirit of promises was always to ensure trustability** -- that promises were immutable (from the outside) to everyone except the initial resolver/deferred -- private state is a critically important feature to preserve.

Many other ES6 promise shims/libs seem to have forgotten that important point, as many of them either expose the state publicly on the object instance or provide public accessor methods which can externally mutate a promise's state. Both of these deviations are **intolerable** in my opinion, so this library chose the opposite trade-off: *no ES6 sub-classing*.

Any trade-off is a shame, but this one is the least of a few evils, and probably won't prove to limit very many, as there are only a limited number of use-cases for `extend`ing `Promise` in the ES6 sub-class sense.

## Still Want More?

This project intentionally adheres pretty strictly to the narrow core of [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com) as adopted/implemented by ES6 into the native `Promise()` mechanism.

But it's quite likely that you will [experience a variety of scenarios](http://blog.getify.com/promises-part-5/) in which using *only* native promises might be tedious, limiting, or more trouble than it's worth. There's good reason why most other **Promises/A+** "compliant" libs are actually superset extensions on the narrow core: **because async flow-control is often quite complex in the real world.**

*Native Promise Only* will **NOT** add any of these extra flourishes. Sorry.

**However, I have another project**: [asynquence](http://github.com/getify/asynquence) (async + sequence). It's an abstraction on top of the promises concept (promises are hidden inside), designed to drastically improve the readability and expressiveness of your async flow-control code.

You simply express your async flow-control and *asynquence* creates and chains all the promises for you underneath. **Super simple.**

*asynquence* has a custom implementation for the internal "promises" it uses, and as such does not need native `Promises`, nor does it need/include this polyfill.

Get your feet wet with native promises first, but then when you go looking for something more, consider [asynquence](http://github.com/getify/asynquence) (which is [vastly more powerful](http://davidwalsh.name/asynquence-part-1) and is still only ~2k!).

## Tests/Compliance

<a href="http://promisesaplus.com/" float="right">
    <img src="http://promisesaplus.com/assets/logo-small.png" alt="Promises/A+ logo"
         title="Promises/A+ 1.1 compliant" align="right" />
</a>

*Native Promise Only* is "spec compliant" in the sense of passing all tests in the [Promises/A+ Test Suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests).

To run all tests:

1. Either git-clone this repo or run `npm install native-promise-only`, and then switch into that project root.
2. Run `npm install` in the project root to install the dev-dependencies.
3. If you didn't get *native-promise-only* from npm, then from the project root, run `./build.js` or `node build.js` or `npm run build` to generate the minified "npo.js" in the project root.
4. Finally, run `npm test`.

**Note:** Other tests need to be added, such as testing the `Promise()` constructor's behavior, as well as the `Promise.*` static helpers (`resolve(..)`, `reject(..)`, `all(..)`, and `race(..)`), none of which are covered by the Promises/A+ test suite.

Developing a more comprehensive test-suite to augment the  Promises/A+ test suite **is now another primary goal** of this project.

# normalize-svg-path

  Convert all segments in a path to curves. Usefull if you intend to animate one shape to another. By defining all segments with curves instead of a mix of lines, arcs, and curves tweening becomes much simpler. It could also help you rewrite your SVG code according to the principles of [narcissistic design](//vimeo.com/77199361).

## Installation

With your favourite package manager:

- [packin](//github.com/jkroso/packin): `packin add normalize-svg-path`
- [component](//github.com/component/component#installing-packages): `component install jkroso/normalize-svg-path`
- [npm](//npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html): `npm install normalize-svg-path`

then in your app:

```js
var normalize = require('normalize-svg-path')
```

## API

### normalize(path)

  Translate each segment in `path` to an equivalent cubic b√©zier curve. The input `path` must be [absolute](//github.com/jkroso/abs-svg-path).

```js
normalize([['L',1,2]]) // => [['C',0,0,1,2,1,2]]
```

License text: # pick-by-alias [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Pick object properties by synonyms. Useful to avoid remembering exact option names from user perspective.

[![npm install pick-by-alias](https://nodei.co/npm/pick-by-alias.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/pick-by-alias/)

```js
let pick = require('pick-by-alias')

let result = pick({
  positions: [...],
  color: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, .75)',
  viewBox: null,
  extra: 123
}, {
  positions: 'positions points data coordinates',
  color: 'colors color stroke',
  viewport: 'viewport viewBox'
})
```

### `pick(object, properties, keepRest=false)`

Return an object with properties picked by the list or dict with aliases. Aliases are matched in priority order, ie. first matching name is picked. Each alias can be an array or a comma/space-separated string.

```js
// pick by dict
let {a, b} = pick(src, {a: ['a', 'b', 'c'], b: 'd e f'})

// pick by list
let {c, d, e} = pick(src, ['c', 'd', 'e'])

// pick by string
let {f, g} = pick(src, 'f g')
```

`keepRest` defines if not listed object properties should be transfered to resulting object or discarded.

License text: # React-Floating-Action-Button
A dead simple React component that works similar to Android's Action Button


![FAB Demo GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/1yMfOTxGP7fvhqccXp/giphy.gif "FAB Demo")

___

### Getting Started
1. First, You need to install It, just like You would do with most any NPM packages:
```
npm i --save react-floating-action-button
```

2. Then, You need to import the library component within your own component
``` javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Container, Button, Link } from 'react-floating-action-button'
```

3. You can now start using the FAB components!
``` javascript
export default const YourAwesomeComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Container>
            <Link href="#"
                tooltip="Create note link"
                icon="far fa-sticky-note" />
            <Link href="#"
                tooltip="Add user link"
                icon="fas fa-user-plus" />
                className="fab-item btn btn-link btn-lg text-white"
            <Button
                tooltip="The big plus button!"
                icon="fas fa-plus"
                rotate={true}
                onClick={() => alert('FAB Rocks!')} />
        </Container>
    )
}
```


### About Components
- **Container** - It's simply a nav element that contains fab-container in its class list. You must involve your fab-items inside a Container, so the default styles are applied properly. Note that the last child will be recognized as the bigger button that is always visible and triggers the menu opening on hover.
- **Button** - A special button element that has the class fab-item and an "i" element as its first child. You can add a function the its click by passing an "onClick" just like you would with a regular button.
- **Link** - Works just like the Button component, but instead of a "onClick", You need to pass a "href" prop to It.

**NOTE**: All components support props.children rendering, which in combination with custom styles, can give You a lot of customization options.

### Extra Styling
- **Container** - You can add custom classes using the "className" property, and also add custom styles by passing a "styles" property with an object just like you would do with the regular style.
- **Button and Link** - Supports all mentioned for the Container, plus gives You the option to add custom icon classes by passing an "icon" string property, and also custom icon styles by passing an object property "iconStyles"

### Material Colors
React-floating-action-button also exports two objects: lightColors and darkColors. These objects contain a few preset material colors that You can use when passing custom styles to the components, and help You to keep the overall design concise.

**Usage**
``` javascript
...
import { Container, Button, lightColors, darkColors } from 'react-floating-action-button'
...
<Container>
    <Button
     tooltip="The big plus button!"
     styles={{backgroundColor: darkColors.lighterRed, color: lightColors.white}}
     />
</Container>

```

License text: # string-split-by [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-orange.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dy/string-split-by.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dy/string-split-by)

Split string by a separator with respect to brackets, quotes and escape markers. Optimized version of [string-split](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/split-string).

## Usage

[![npm install string-split-by](https://nodei.co/npm/string-split-by.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/string-split-by/)


```js
var split = require('string-split-by')

split('a."b.c".d.{.e.f.g.}.h', '.')
// ['a', '"b.c"', 'd', '{.e.f.g.}', 'h']

split('a."b.c".d.{.e.f.g.}.h', '.', {ignore: '""'})
// ['a', '"b.c"', 'd', '{', 'e', 'f', 'g', '}', 'h']
```

## API

### parts = splitBy(string, separator, options?)

Return array with parts split from string by a separator, which can be whether _String_ or _RegExp_. Options can define:

Option | Default | Meaning
---|---|---
`ignore` | ``['"', "'", '`', '‚Äú‚Äù', '¬´¬ª', '[]', '()', '{}']`` | Avoid splitting content enclosed in the character pairs. Can be a string or a list of strings.

Retrieve bounding box from svg path data.

## Usage

[![npm install svg-path-bounds](https://nodei.co/npm/svg-path-bounds.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/svg-path-bounds/)

```js
const getBounds = require('svg-path-bounds')

let [left, top, right, bottom] = getBounds('M0 0L10 10 20 0Z') // [0, 0, 20, 10]
```

## API

### bounds = getBounds(path|segments)

Calculate bounding box for [svg path data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d) string or [parsed path segments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-svg-path) array. The box is detected by controlling points, not the real path.

## Related

Create signed distance field for an svg path data.

![svg-path-sdf](https://github.com/dy/svg-path-sdf/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true)

## Usage

[![npm install svg-path-sdf](https://nodei.co/npm/svg-path-sdf.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/svg-path-sdf/)

```js
let pathSdf = require('svg-path-sdf')

let arr = pathSdf('M40,0A40,40 0 1,1 0,-40A40,40 0 0,1 40,0Z', {
	width: 200,
	height: 200
})
```

`arr` has `200√ó200` elements with value from `0..1` range, corresponding to distance. The path is drawn at the center of the sdf fitting to the minimum side.

## distances = pathSdf(path, options|shape?)

Option | Meaning
---|---
`width`,`w`, `height`,`h` or `shape` | Output sdf size in px, defaults to `200√ó200`.
`cutoff`, `radius` | SDF parameters for [bitmap-sdf](https://github.com/dy/bitmap-sdf), by default detected from shape to fit min side.
`viewBox` | View box for the path data. If not defined, it is detected as path bounds via [svg-path-bounds](https://github.com/dy/svg-path-bounds).
`stroke` | Whether to stroke shape. Positive number will stroke outside the amount of pixels, negative number will stroke inside, `0`-ish will disable stroke.

Package: weak-map@1.0.8
Repository: https://github.com/drses/weak-map
Publisher: Mark Miller

License: Apache-2.0
License Filename: README.md
License text: 
`WeakMap` is a collection slated to be introduced to JavaScript with
EcmaScript 6.  It provides a mapping from objects to values, but allows
any entry to be garbage collected if the key is provably lost.

In order for it to be possible that a key is provably lost, weak maps do
not provide a way to access the key list.

This is a Node Packaged Module (NPM) that provides a shim and patcher
for missing or broken WeakMap implementations suitable for use in
Node.js and browsers that provide the EcmaScript 5 property description
interfaces provided that it hosted by a CommonJS loader or bundler like
[Browserify][], [Montage][], [Mr][], or [Mop][].

[Browserify]: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[Montage]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr
[Mr]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr
[Mop]: https://github.com/montagejs/mop

```
npm install weak-map --save
```

```javascript
var WeakMap = require("weak-map");
var map = new WeakMap();
var key = {};
map.set(key, "Hello, World!");
map.get(key) === "Hello, World!";
key = null;
// "Hello, World!" may be collected
```

See [MDN][] for the API details.

[MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap

At time of writing, prototype implementations of `WeakMap` exist in V8
and Spidermonkey.  The prototype is available in Node.js v0.10 with the
`--harmony_collections` V8 option.  In v0.8, it was available with
`--harmony_weakmaps`.  The purpose of this package is to enable
dependees to use weak maps regardless of whether they are implemented by
the underlying engine, albeit in a way that leaks memory in some
non-obvious cases.

### Purpose and limitation

This shim depends on and modifies ECMAScript 5 property descriptor related
methods, `Object.defineProperty`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`,
`Object.isExtensible`, `Object.freeze`, and `Object.seal`.

In a nutshell, the WeakMap shim emulates a WeakMap by adding a hidden
property to the key that associates the weak map with the retained
object. The shim overrides the ECMAScript 5 methods to cover its tracks.

Consider a scenario that only includes a weak map, a key, and a corresponding
value through the weak map. With a proper `WeakMap`, built into the JavaScript
engine privy to the internals of the garbage collector, the `value` would be
retained either by the key or the weak map. If *either* the key or the weak map
are elligible for garbage collection, the value is elligible.

This is in contrast to to a plain `Map`. In a scenario with a map, a key, and a
value corresponding to the key through the map, neither the key nor the value
will be eligible for garbage collection until the map containing them is
elligible. Thus, if a map is used to establish a relationship between ephemeral
keys and values, it will accumulate garbage.

This shim does its best to approximate a proper `WeakMap` without an intimate
relationship with the garbage collector. In the same scenario, the value will
become elligible for garbage collection if the key is elligible. Unlike a proper
weak map, if the weak map shim becomes elligible for garbage collection but the
key is retained by something else, the value will be retained. In this scenario,
all operations of the weak map take constant time.

However, if the key is *frozen*, the weak map retains both the key and the value
and neither are elligible for collection until the weak map becomes elligible
itself. This scenario is unfortunately identical to the behavior of a `Map`.
Additionally, all operations of the weak map suffer linear time.

As stated by Mark Miller in the code:

> As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not retain maps indexed by
> that key and (crucially) a map does not retain the keys it indexes. A map by
> itself also does not retain the values associated with that map.
>
> However, the values associated with a key in some map are retained so long as
> that key is retained and those associations are not overridden. For example,
> when used to support membranes, all values exported from a given membrane will
> live for the lifetime they would have had in the absence of an interposed
> membrane. Even when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been
> reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as far as the
> GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant to ongoing
> computation.
>
> The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
> in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,
> rather than the offially approved proposal page.
>
> The first difference between the emulation here and that in FF6.0a1 is the
> presence of non enumerable `get___`, `has___`, `set___`, and `delete___`}
> methods on WeakMap instances to represent what would be the hidden internal
> properties of a primitive implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype
> methods require their `this` to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e., an object
> of `[[Class]]` "WeakMap}), since there is nothing unforgeable about the
> pseudo-internal method names used here, nothing prevents these emulated
> prototype methods from being applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal
> methods of the same names.
>
> Another difference is that our emulated `WeakMap.prototype` is not itself a
> WeakMap. A problem with the current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is
> itself a WeakMap providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications
> channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this problem,
> repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to prevent access to this
> channel. (See PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).

This refers to `repairES5.js` as provided by Google Caja.

### Origin and license

The canonical implementation of `WeakMap` exists in the Google Caja
Subversion repository at http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
It was written by Mark S. Miller.  It is released by Google with the
Apache 2.0 license.  This package is maintained by Kris Kowal.

This work began with [Mark Miller‚Äôs proposal][Proposal] for `WeakMap` to ECMA‚Äôs
TC-39, where the JavaScript standard is developed.
